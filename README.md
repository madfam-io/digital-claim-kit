## How to Use

1.  **Open the `index.html` file** in any modern web browser.
2.  **Set Your Brand Profile:** When you first open the app, a "Brand Profile" panel will appear. Configure your target markets, audience, and content strengths. This profile is used to calculate the priority scores. You can edit it anytime by clicking the "Perfil de Marca" / "Brand Profile" button.
3.  **Review Your Priorities:** The main grid will automatically update, sorting platforms by their relevance to you. Platforms with higher scores are your top priorities.
4.  **Claim Your Platforms:** Work your way through the list. As you claim each profile, update its status using the dropdown menu on its card. For "Claimed" platforms, you can add your specific handle or URL in the text field that appears.
5.  **Explore Details:** Click the info icon on any card to see why a platform was scored the way it was and to get quick links to its claim page and official documentation.
6.  **Adjust and Filter:** Use the search and filter controls at the top to narrow down the list as you work.

Your progress is saved automatically, so you can close the page and pick up right where you left off.
